## 1. Pipeline Architecture

### TradingAgents — LangGraph StateGraph

```
START
 ↓
[Market Analyst] → tool loop → [Msg Clear]
 ↓
[Social Analyst] → tool loop → [Msg Clear]
 ↓
[News Analyst] → tool loop → [Msg Clear]
 ↓
[Fundamentals Analyst] → tool loop → [Msg Clear]
 ↓
[Bull ↔ Bear] × max_debate_rounds (configurable loops)
 ↓
[Research Manager] → ResearchPlan (Pydantic)
 ↓
[Trader] → TraderProposal (Pydantic)
 ↓
[Aggressive ↔ Conservative ↔ Neutral] × max_risk_discuss_rounds (configurable loops)
 ↓
[Portfolio Manager] → PortfolioDecision (Pydantic)
 ↓
END
```

- **Orchestration:** `StateGraph` with conditional edges and message-routing logic
- **Analyst tools:** Each analyst can call tools multiple times (loop until no tool calls remain)
- **Debate loops:** Controlled by `count >= 2 * max_debate_rounds` / `3 * max_risk_discuss_rounds`
- **All 13 agents run sequentially** — no true parallelism in the graph

### claude-trading-agents — Claude Code Skill

```
Phase 1 (PARALLEL):
  [Technical Analyst] ──┐
  [News Analyst]        ├─── all spawn simultaneously via Agent tool
  [Fundamentals Analyst]┘
         ↓ (wait for all 3)
Phase 2 (PARALLEL):
  [Bull Analyst] ───┐
  [Bear Analyst]    ├─── receive Phase 1 reports as context
                    ┘
         ↓ (wait for both)
Phase 3 (no LLM):
  [Portfolio Manager] → template-based decision formatting
         ↓
Phase 4:
  → Post to Slack (#investment, #gliaclaw-investment)
```

- **Orchestration:** Claude Code's native `Agent` tool — no graph framework
- **Parallelism:** Phases 1 and 2 spawn agents concurrently (genuine parallel execution)
- **No loops:** Each agent runs once and returns a report
- **Phase 3 is not an LLM call** — the main skill session formats the decision from sentinel strings

## 2. Agent Comparison

### 2.1 Analyst Agents

| Analyst | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Market/Technical** | Calls `get_stock_data` + `get_indicators` in a tool loop; selects up to 8 indicators; multi-call until satisfied | Single Bash call to `fetch_market_data.py --type technical`; always fetches fixed 11 indicators; one-shot |
| **Social/Sentiment** | Calls `get_news` in tool loop; focused on social media + sentiment scores | Calls `fetch_market_data.py --type news`; yfinance news headlines only; no sentiment scoring |
| **News** | Calls `get_news` + `get_global_news` + `get_insider_transactions`; covers macro + company-specific | Merged into News analyst via same yfinance headlines; no macro coverage; no insider data |
| **Fundamentals** | Calls `get_fundamentals` + `get_balance_sheet` + `get_cashflow` + `get_income_statement`; all 4 financial statements | Single call to `fetch_market_data.py --type fundamentals`; yfinance info dict; no separate statements |

**Key difference:** TradingAgents analysts use **LangChain tool loops** — they can call tools multiple times to gather more data before writing the report. claude-trading-agents analysts make exactly **one Bash call** and analyze whatever JSON is returned.

**Signal output:**

| System | Output Format |
|--------|--------------|
| TradingAgents | Free-form markdown report (no structured signal) |
| claude-trading-agents | `TECHNICAL SIGNAL: BULLISH \| BEARISH \| NEUTRAL` sentinel at the end of each report |

### 2.2 Debate Agents

| Dimension | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Debate type** | Bidirectional iterative: Bull speaks, Bear responds, repeat | Single-pass parallel: Bull and Bear each write once independently |
| **Rounds** | `max_debate_rounds` (default 1 = Bull+Bear each speak once; configurable to 2, 3…) | Always 1 round, not configurable |
| **Context** | Full accumulated `history` + `current_response` of opponent's last message | Both receive Phase 1 reports; neither sees the other's output |
| **Counter-argumentation** | Bull explicitly responds to Bear's `current_response` (and vice versa) | Bull makes its case without seeing Bear's argument; no direct rebuttal |
| **Conviction output** | No explicit signal; full prose passed to Research Manager | `BULL CONVICTION: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW` sentinel |

**Critical design gap:** In claude-trading-agents, Bull and Bear agents run in parallel and never see each other's arguments. There is no actual *debate* — it's two independent analyses. TradingAgents has true adversarial dialogue where each side directly rebuts the other.

### 2.3 Manager / Synthesizer Agents

| Dimension | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Research Manager** | Full LLM agent that reads the debate history and renders a `ResearchPlan` (Pydantic: recommendation + rationale + strategic_actions) | **Not implemented** |
| **Trader** | Full LLM agent that converts ResearchPlan → `TraderProposal` (action + reasoning + entry_price + stop_loss + position_sizing) | **Not implemented** |
| **Risk Debate** | 3-way rotating debate: Aggressive/Conservative/Neutral analysts each speak `max_risk_discuss_rounds` times | **Not implemented** |
| **Portfolio Manager** | Full LLM agent reads entire risk debate + Research Manager plan + Trader proposal + memory context → `PortfolioDecision` | **Template-based (no LLM):** Main skill parses conviction sentinels and fills a fixed text template |

The Portfolio Manager in claude-trading-agents is essentially a **string formatter** — it compares `BULL CONVICTION: HIGH` vs `BEAR CONVICTION: MEDIUM` and picks the winner, then formats a pre-defined output block. No LLM reasoning is applied at this stage.

---

## 3. State Management

### TradingAgents

```python
class AgentState(MessagesState):
    company_of_interest: str
    trade_date: str
    market_report: str
    sentiment_report: str
    news_report: str
    fundamentals_report: str
    investment_debate_state: InvestDebateState   # Nested: history, count, current_response...
    investment_plan: str
    trader_investment_plan: str
    risk_debate_state: RiskDebateState           # Nested: aggressive_history, count, latest_speaker...
    final_trade_decision: str
    past_context: str                            # Injected from memory log
```

- State persists across all 13 nodes via LangGraph's `MessagesState`
- Nested `InvestDebateState` and `RiskDebateState` track conversation turns, counts, and per-speaker history
- SQLite checkpoint per-ticker means state can **resume mid-run** if interrupted

### claude-trading-agents

```python
# No AgentState class. State = Python variables in the skill's execution context:
technical_report: str    # Phase 1 output
news_report: str         # Phase 1 output
fundamentals_report: str # Phase 1 output
bull_report: str         # Phase 2 output
bear_report: str         # Phase 2 output
# Phase 3: parse signals from above strings → format output string
```

- State is entirely in-memory during the skill's single execution
- No checkpointing — if the skill is interrupted, it must restart from the beginning
- No nested debate state — conviction is extracted via text parsing (`BULL CONVICTION: HIGH`)

---

## 4. Tool System

### TradingAgents — LangChain Tool Abstraction

```python
# 9 abstract tools, vendor-routed at runtime
@tool def get_stock_data(symbol, start_date, end_date) -> str: ...
@tool def get_indicators(symbol, indicator, curr_date, look_back_days) -> str: ...
@tool def get_fundamentals(ticker, curr_date) -> str: ...
@tool def get_balance_sheet(ticker, freq, curr_date) -> str: ...
@tool def get_cashflow(ticker, freq, curr_date) -> str: ...
@tool def get_income_statement(ticker, curr_date) -> str: ...
@tool def get_news(ticker, start_date, end_date) -> str: ...
@tool def get_global_news(curr_date, look_back_days, limit) -> str: ...
@tool def get_insider_transactions(ticker) -> str: ...
```

- All tools are LangChain `@tool` functions bound to each agent's LLM
- Agents can call any combination of tools, in any order, as many times as needed
- Tools route to yfinance **or** Alpha Vantage based on config (`data_vendors`, `tool_vendors`)
- Returns **formatted prose strings** with markdown tables for LLM consumption

### claude-trading-agents — Bash + Single Python Script

```bash
# 3 tool variants, fixed argument sets
uv run python fetch_market_data.py --ticker NVDA --type technical     --date 2026-05-02
uv run python fetch_market_data.py --ticker NVDA --type news          --date 2026-05-02
uv run python fetch_market_data.py --ticker NVDA --type fundamentals  --date 2026-05-02
```

- Single Python script, 3 data types, no vendor routing
- Returns raw JSON (subagent interprets the JSON directly)
- Each subagent calls exactly one tool variant — no flexibility in which data to fetch
- No insider transactions, no global macro news, no separate financial statements

**Data coverage gap:**

| Data Type | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| OHLCV price history | ✅ | ✅ (recent 10 closes only) |
| 12 technical indicators | ✅ (selects up to 8 from 12) | ✅ (fixed 11) |
| Company news | ✅ | ✅ |
| Global macro news | ✅ | ❌ |
| Social media sentiment | ✅ | ❌ (yfinance news only) |
| Insider transactions | ✅ | ❌ |
| Balance sheet | ✅ (separate tool) | Partial (within fundamentals JSON) |
| Cash flow statement | ✅ (separate tool) | Partial |
| Income statement | ✅ (separate tool) | Partial |
| Analyst ratings | ✅ (via fundamentals) | ✅ (recommendationMean, targetPrice) |
| Alternative data vendor | ✅ (Alpha Vantage) | ❌ |

## 5. Prompt Design

### Analyst Prompts

**TradingAgents Market Analyst** — highly structured instruction with:
- Full indicator catalog with descriptions, usage, and tips for each
- Instruction to select up to 8 *complementary* indicators avoiding redundancy
- Requires `get_stock_data` first, then `get_indicators` with exact parameter names
- Ends with: "Write a very detailed and nuanced report... append a Markdown table"

**claude-trading-agents Technical Analyst** — lighter instruction:
- Calls fixed Bash command, receives JSON
- Interprets 11 pre-fetched indicators
- Must end with `TECHNICAL SIGNAL: BULLISH | BEARISH | NEUTRAL`
- "150-200 words" length constraint

**Key difference:** TradingAgents market analyst exercises **judgment in tool selection** (which 8 of 12 indicators to use and why). The claude-trading-agents analyst receives a fixed data dump and interprets it.

### Debate Prompts

**TradingAgents Bull/Bear** — adversarial dialogue style:
```
Last bear argument: {current_response}
Use this information to deliver a compelling bull argument, refute the bear's
concerns, and engage in a dynamic debate...
```

**claude-trading-agents Bull/Bear** — parallel independent advocacy:
```
Make the strongest possible BUY/HOLD case for {ticker} using specific data points.
Address potential bear objections head-on.
[Insert Phase 1 reports]
End your analysis with: BULL CONVICTION: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
```

The claude-trading-agents debaters address *anticipated* bear objections, not *actual* ones. Since they run in parallel, neither has seen the other's argument.

### Manager Prompts

**TradingAgents Portfolio Manager** — multi-source synthesis:
```
Research Manager's investment plan: {research_plan}
Trader's transaction proposal: {trader_plan}
Lessons from prior decisions: {past_context}
Risk Analysts Debate History: {history}

Be decisive and ground every conclusion in specific evidence from the analysts.
```

**claude-trading-agents Portfolio Manager** — no LLM prompt at all. The main skill uses regex to parse conviction sentinels and fills a fixed template:
```
TICKER: {symbol}
SIGNAL: BUY / SELL / HOLD
BULL: {one sentence from bull report}
BEAR: {one sentence from bear report}
VERDICT: {2-3 sentences}
```

---

## 6. Memory & Learning

### TradingAgents — Outcome-Based Reflection Loop

```
Run 1 (AAPL, 2026-01-15):
  → Store: [2026-01-15 | AAPL | Buy | pending]

Run 2 (AAPL, 2026-01-22):
  → Resolve pending entry:
      fetch price return over 5-day holding period
      compare vs SPY (alpha)
      generate 2-4 sentence reflection via LLM
      update: [2026-01-15 | AAPL | Buy | +3.2% | +1.5% | 5d]
  → Inject into Portfolio Manager:
      "Past analyses of AAPL: [entry with reflection]"
      "Recent cross-ticker lessons: [TSLA reflection]"
```

Every Portfolio Manager call receives lessons from:
- Up to 5 most recent same-ticker decisions (with outcomes)
- Up to 3 most recent cross-ticker lessons (reflection text only)

### claude-trading-agents — No Memory

Each run is entirely stateless. There is no mechanism to:
- Track past decisions
- Measure outcomes
- Reflect on what worked
- Inject historical context into future runs

This is the single largest qualitative difference in **decision quality over time** — TradingAgents improves with each run; claude-trading-agents starts fresh every time.

---

## 7. Structured Output vs Sentinel Strings

### TradingAgents — Pydantic Schemas

```python
class PortfolioDecision(BaseModel):
    rating: PortfolioRating       # Enum: Buy/Overweight/Hold/Underweight/Sell
    executive_summary: str        # 2-4 sentences
    investment_thesis: str        # Detailed with evidence
    price_target: Optional[float]
    time_horizon: Optional[str]
```

- Provider-native structured output (tool-use for Anthropic, response_schema for Gemini, function_calling for OpenAI)
- Pydantic validation ensures type correctness
- Graceful fallback: if structured fails, free-text is parsed heuristically
- Rendered to consistent markdown for downstream use

### claude-trading-agents — Sentinel Strings

```
TECHNICAL SIGNAL: BULLISH
SENTIMENT SIGNAL: POSITIVE
FUNDAMENTAL SIGNAL: STRONG
BULL CONVICTION: HIGH
BEAR CONVICTION: MEDIUM
```

- Parsed by the main skill using simple string matching
- No validation — if an agent omits the sentinel or uses wrong formatting, Phase 3 logic breaks
- No structured schema; confidence levels are ordinal strings ("HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW"), not floats
- Cannot distinguish "Overweight" from "Buy" — decision collapses to 3 values (BUY/SELL/HOLD)

---

## 8. LLM Provider Architecture

### TradingAgents

```python
# Factory pattern with 10+ providers
create_llm_client(provider="anthropic", model="claude-opus-4-6", effort="high")
create_llm_client(provider="openai",    model="gpt-5.4",          reasoning_effort="medium")
create_llm_client(provider="google",    model="gemini-3-pro",      thinking_level="high")
create_llm_client(provider="xai",       model="grok-4.1")
create_llm_client(provider="ollama",    model="llama3.2")

# Two-tier model assignment
deep_thinking_llm  → Research Manager, Portfolio Manager
quick_thinking_llm → All 4 analysts, Trader, 3 risk analysts
```

### claude-trading-agents

```python
# No LLM configuration at all
# Uses whatever model Claude Code is running (claude-sonnet-4-6 by default)
# All 5 subagents use the same implicit model
# No deep/quick split
```

---

## 9. Output & Delivery

### TradingAgents

- **Terminal:** Rich TUI with live agent status, token counts, message stream
- **Files:** `~/.tradingagents/logs/{ticker}/{date}/` with per-agent markdown reports
  - `1_analysts/market.md`, `sentiment.md`, `news.md`, `fundamentals.md`
  - `2_research/bull.md`, `bear.md`, `manager.md`
  - `3_trading/trader.md`
  - `4_risk/aggressive.md`, `conservative.md`, `neutral.md`
  - `5_portfolio/decision.md`
  - `complete_report.md` (consolidated)
- **No Slack integration**

### claude-trading-agents

- **Terminal:** Standard Claude Code output
- **No file output**
- **Slack:** Posts formatted decision card to `#investment` and `#gliaclaw-investment`

The output format for the decision card:example

```
*NVDA* — *BUY (Overweight)* 📈

📊 Technical: BULLISH | 📰 Sentiment: POSITIVE | 💼 Fundamentals: STRONG

🐂 Bull: Forward P/E of 17.8x for 96% earnings growth is cheap.
🐻 Bear: Competing chips from Google/Amazon are a long-term risk.

✅ Verdict: Fundamentals overwhelm near-term noise. Buy in two tranches, stop below SMA200.

Entry: $199-201 | Stop: $183 | Size: 3-5% of portfolio
```

## 10. Gap Analysis — What Would Make claude-trading-agents Closer to the Original

Ordered by implementation impact:

| Gap | Effort | Impact | Notes |
|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| **True adversarial debate** | Medium | High | Run Bull/Bear sequentially so Bear sees Bull's output and rebuts it directly |
| **LLM-based Portfolio Manager** | Low | High | Replace template formatting with an actual LLM synthesis call |
| **Risk analysis phase** | High | High | Add 3 risk analyst subagents (Aggressive/Conservative/Neutral) between Phase 2 and the PM |
| **Persistent memory** | High | High | Store decisions in a markdown log; inject past context into PM prompt on each run |
| **Research Manager agent** | Low | Medium | Add a synthesis step between debate and Trader that produces a structured investment plan |
| **Outcome reflection** | High | Medium | Fetch price returns after 5 days; generate reflection; update log |
| **Macro news coverage** | Low | Medium | Add a separate macro news tool (currently only company-specific news via yfinance) |
| **Insider transaction data** | Low | Low | Add insider transactions fetch to the News analyst |
| **Configurable debate rounds** | Low | Low | Let users pass `max_debate_rounds` as a skill argument |
| **Structured output** | Medium | Low | Replace sentinel strings with JSON output and parse with Pydantic |
| **Separate financial statements** | Low | Low | Add `--type balance_sheet`, `--type cashflow`, `--type income` to the fetch script |
| **File-based report saving** | Low | Low | Write per-agent reports to `~/.claude-trading/logs/{ticker}/{date}/` |

---

## 11. Design Philosophy Comparison

| Aspect | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Goal** | Research framework exploring LLM-driven multi-agent debate for trading | Practical daily trading copilot with Slack delivery |
| **Audience** | Researchers, LLM engineers, quantitative analysts | Individual investors, traders who use Claude Code |
| **Extensibility** | High — swappable LLM providers, data vendors, configurable agents | Low — single skill file, fixed pipeline |
| **Observability** | Rich TUI, per-agent report files, token counters | Basic Claude Code terminal output |
| **Cost model** | External LLM API costs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google API keys required) | Included in Claude Code subscription |
| **Setup complexity** | Moderate (Python env, API keys, config) | Minimal (one skill file, one Python script) |
| **Latency** | 3–10 minutes per ticker | 1–2 minutes per ticker |
| **Decision quality** | Higher — iterative debate, risk analysis, memory-augmented | Adequate — single-pass with no memory |
| **Parallelism** | None in graph (sequential nodes) | Yes — Phases 1 and 2 run agents in parallel |

---

## Summary

claude-trading-agents is a **practical, lightweight daily trading assistant** optimized for Claude Code users who want a fast, low-friction analysis with Slack delivery. It captures the core insight of TradingAgents (specialist analysts + bull/bear debate) while cutting complexity by 80%.

The three most impactful missing pieces are:

1. **True adversarial debate** — Bull and Bear should see each other's arguments before responding
2. **LLM Portfolio Manager** — the final synthesis should be an LLM call, not a template
3. **Persistent memory** — the system should learn from past decisions and their outcomes
