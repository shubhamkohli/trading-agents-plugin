# Prompt-by-Prompt Comparison: TradingAgents vs claude-trading-agents

> All prompt text is quoted verbatim from source files.

## 1. Technical / Market Analyst

### TradingAgents — `market_analyst.py`

Two-layer prompt: a **shared wrapper** (same for all tool-using agents) + a **role-specific system message**.

**Wrapper (system):**
```
You are a helpful AI assistant, collaborating with other assistants. Use the
provided tools to progress towards answering the question. If you are unable to
fully answer, that's OK; another assistant with different tools will help where
you left off. Execute what you can to make progress. If you or any other assistant
has the FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL** or deliverable, prefix your
response with FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL** so the team knows to stop.
You have access to the following tools: {tool_names}.
{system_message}
For your reference, the current date is {current_date}. {instrument_context}
```

**Role system message:**
```
You are a trading assistant tasked with analyzing financial markets. Your role is
to select the **most relevant indicators** for a given market condition or trading
strategy from the following list. The goal is to choose up to **8 indicators** that
provide complementary insights without redundancy. Categories and each category's
indicators are:

Moving Averages:
- close_50_sma: 50 SMA: A medium-term trend indicator. Usage: Identify trend
  direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance. Tips: It lags price; combine
  with faster indicators for timely signals.
- close_200_sma: 200 SMA: A long-term trend benchmark. Usage: Confirm overall
  market trend and identify golden/death cross setups. Tips: It reacts slowly; best
  for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.
- close_10_ema: 10 EMA: A responsive short-term average. Usage: Capture quick
  shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Tips: Prone to noise in choppy
  markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.

MACD Related:
- macd: MACD: Computes momentum via differences of EMAs. Usage: Look for
  crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes. Tips: Confirm with other
  indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.
- macds: MACD Signal: An EMA smoothing of the MACD line. Usage: Use crossovers
  with the MACD line to trigger trades. Tips: Should be part of a broader strategy
  to avoid false positives.
- macdh: MACD Histogram: Shows the gap between the MACD line and its signal.
  Usage: Visualize momentum strength and spot divergence early. Tips: Can be
  volatile; complement with additional filters in fast-moving markets.

Momentum Indicators:
- rsi: RSI: Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions. Usage:
  Apply 70/30 thresholds and watch for divergence to signal reversals. Tips: In
  strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.

Volatility Indicators:
- boll: Bollinger Middle: A 20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands.
- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band: Typically 2 standard deviations above the middle.
- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band: Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle.
- atr: ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility. Usage: Set stop-loss levels
  and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility.

Volume-Based Indicators:
- vwma: VWMA: A moving average weighted by volume.

Select indicators that provide diverse and complementary information. Avoid
redundancy (e.g., do not select both rsi and stochrsi). Also briefly explain why
they are suitable for the given market context. When you tool call, please use the
exact name of the indicators provided above as they are defined parameters,
otherwise your call will fail. Please make sure to call get_stock_data first to
retrieve the CSV that is needed to generate indicators. Then use get_indicators
with the specific indicator names. Write a very detailed and nuanced report of
the trends you observe. Provide specific, actionable insights with supporting
evidence to help traders make informed decisions. Make sure to append a Markdown
table at the end of the report to organize key points in the report, organized
and easy to read.

### Diff

| Dimension | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Prompt length** | ~800 words | ~60 words |
| **Indicator knowledge** | Full catalog embedded — name, description, usage, tips for each | No catalog; analyst works from whatever JSON arrives |
| **Tool use** | Agent decides which tools to call and in what order (must call `get_stock_data` first, then `get_indicators` with chosen names) | One fixed Bash command; no choice |
| **Indicator selection** | LLM chooses up to 8 complementary indicators and explains why each fits the current context | 11 indicators always fetched; no selection judgment |
| **Output format** | Free-form markdown with required Markdown table at end; no signal sentinel | Bullet-structured, 150-200 word cap, must end with `TECHNICAL SIGNAL:` sentinel |
| **Output length** | Unconstrained ("very detailed and nuanced") | Hard cap 150-200 words |
| **Collaboration framing** | Explicitly positioned as part of a team ("collaborating with other assistants") | Solo analyst; no team framing |
| **i18n** | `get_language_instruction()` appended — supports 50+ languages | English only |

**Key insight:** TradingAgents gives the LLM *domain knowledge* (what each indicator means and when to use it) and lets it *reason about which ones to pick*. The claude-trading-agents version skips that judgment entirely — dump all indicators, let the LLM interpret them.

---

## 2. News Analyst

### TradingAgents — `news_analyst.py`

```
You are a news researcher tasked with analyzing recent news and trends over the
past week. Please write a comprehensive report of the current state of the world
that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics. Use the available tools:

searches, and get_global_news(curr_date, look_back_days, limit) for broader
macroeconomic news. Provide specific, actionable insights with supporting evidence
to help traders make informed decisions. Make sure to append a Markdown table at
the end of the report to organize key points in the report, organized and easy
to read.
```

**Tools:** `get_news` + `get_global_news`

---

### TradingAgents — `social_media_analyst.py` (separate agent)

```
You are a social media and company specific news researcher/analyst tasked with
analyzing social media posts, recent company news, and public sentiment for a
specific company over the past week. You will be given a company's name your
objective is to write a comprehensive long report detailing your analysis,
insights, and implications for traders and investors on this company's current
state after looking at social media and what people are saying about that company,
analyzing sentiment data of what people feel each day about the company, and
looking at recent company news. Use the get_news(query, start_date, end_date)
tool to search for company-specific news and social media discussions. Try to
look at all sources possible from social media to sentiment to news. Provide
specific, actionable insights with supporting evidence to help traders make
informed decisions. Make sure to append a Markdown table at the end of the
report to organize key points in the report, organized and easy to read.
```

**Tools:** `get_news` only

---

### claude-trading-agents — `trading-analysis.md` (Subagent 2)

```
You are a news and sentiment analyst for $TICKER as of $TODAY.

Fetch data:
uv run --project ... fetch_market_data.py --ticker $TICKER --type news --date $TODAY

Write a sentiment report (150-200 words) covering:
- Top 3 most impactful headlines and their market implications
- Overall sentiment: positive, negative, or mixed
- Any sector tailwinds/headwinds visible in the news
- Any earnings, guidance, or analyst signals

End with exactly: SENTIMENT SIGNAL: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL
```

---

### Diff

| Dimension | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Agent count** | 2 separate agents (News Analyst + Social Media Analyst) | 1 merged agent |
| **News scope** | News Analyst: macro + company-specific. Social Analyst: social media + daily sentiment | Company news headlines only via yfinance |
| **Macro coverage** | `get_global_news` fetches broad macroeconomic news | None — no macro coverage |
| **Social media** | Explicitly prompted to find "social media posts" and "sentiment data of what people feel each day" | Not mentioned; yfinance doesn't provide it |
| **Tool calls** | Can call `get_news` and `get_global_news` multiple times with different queries | One fixed Bash call |
| **Output format** | Comprehensive long report with Markdown table | 150-200 words, 4 bullet topics, `SENTIMENT SIGNAL:` sentinel |

**Key insight:** TradingAgents splits news into two dimensions — **macro/world** (News Analyst) and **social/sentiment** (Social Analyst). claude-trading-agents collapses these into one agent with no macro coverage and no true social sentiment data.

---

## 3. Fundamentals Analyst

### TradingAgents — `fundamentals_analyst.py`

```
You are a researcher tasked with analyzing fundamental information over the past
week about a company. Please write a comprehensive report of the company's
fundamental information such as financial documents, company profile, basic
company financials, and company financial history to gain a full view of the
company's fundamental information to inform traders. Make sure to include as much
detail as possible. Provide specific, actionable insights with supporting evidence
to help traders make informed decisions. Make sure to append a Markdown table at
the end of the report to organize key points in the report, organized and easy to
read. Use the available tools: `get_fundamentals` for comprehensive company
analysis, `get_balance_sheet`, `get_cashflow`, and `get_income_statement` for
specific financial statements.
```

**Tools:** `get_fundamentals` + `get_balance_sheet` + `get_cashflow` + `get_income_statement`

---

### claude-trading-agents — `trading-analysis.md` (Subagent 3)

- Analyst consensus: mean recommendation (1=Strong Buy, 5=Sell), price target vs current price

End with exactly: FUNDAMENTAL SIGNAL: STRONG, FAIR, or WEAK
```

---

### Diff

| Dimension | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Data depth** | 4 separate tools — comprehensive fundamentals + full balance sheet + cash flow + income statement | Single JSON blob from yfinance `.info` dict |
| **Financial statements** | Full multi-year statements (quarterly or annual, separate tool per statement) | Derived ratios only (FCF, margins — no line-item data) |
| **Report instruction** | "Include as much detail as possible" — open-ended length | 150-200 word hard cap |
| **Output guidance** | 4 bullet topics prescribed; `FUNDAMENTAL SIGNAL:` sentinel | No prescribed structure |
| **Signal categories** | STRONG / FAIR / WEAK (3-way) | No signal output |

---

## 4. Bull Researcher

### TradingAgents — `bull_researcher.py`

```python
prompt = f"""You are a Bull Analyst advocating for investing in the stock. Your
task is to build a strong, evidence-based case emphasizing growth potential,
competitive advantages, and positive market indicators. Leverage the provided
research and data to address concerns and counter bearish arguments effectively.

Key points to focus on:
- Growth Potential: Highlight the company's market opportunities, revenue
  projections, and scalability.
- Competitive Advantages: Emphasize factors like unique products, strong branding,
  or dominant market positioning.
- Positive Indicators: Use financial health, industry trends, and recent positive
  news as evidence.
- Bear Counterpoints: Critically analyze the bear argument with specific data and
  sound reasoning, addressing concerns thoroughly and showing why the bull
  perspective holds stronger merit.
- Engagement: Present your argument in a conversational style, engaging directly
  with the bear analyst's points and debating effectively rather than just listing
  data.

Resources available:
Market research report: {market_research_report}
Social media sentiment report: {sentiment_report}
Latest world affairs news: {news_report}
Company fundamentals report: {fundamentals_report}
Conversation history of the debate: {history}
Last bear argument: {current_response}
Use this information to deliver a compelling bull argument, refute the bear's
concerns, and engage in a dynamic debate that demonstrates the strengths of the
bull position.
"""
```

---

### claude-trading-agents — `trading-analysis.md` (Subagent 4)

```
You are a bull analyst. Make the strongest BUY case for $TICKER using these
research reports:

TECHNICAL REPORT:
[insert full technical report from Phase 1]

NEWS REPORT:
[insert full news report from Phase 1]

FUNDAMENTALS REPORT:
[insert full fundamentals report from Phase 1]

Write 150-200 words. Use specific data points. Address the most obvious bear
objections head-on. Be direct and confident.

End with exactly: BULL CONVICTION: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
```

---

### Diff

| Dimension | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Opponent awareness** | Receives `current_response` — the Bear's most recent actual argument | No opponent; Bull runs in parallel with Bear and never sees Bear's output |
| **Debate history** | Receives full `history` of all prior turns | No history — always first-turn |
| **Counter-argumentation** | Explicitly required: "Critically analyze the bear argument with specific data" | "Address the most obvious bear objections" — addressing *imagined* objections, not real ones |
| **Engagement style** | "Conversational style, engaging directly with the bear analyst's points" | "Be direct and confident" — advocacy, not dialogue |
| **Conviction output** | None — full prose passed to Research Manager | `BULL CONVICTION: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW` sentinel |
| **Report context** | 4 reports (market, sentiment, news, fundamentals) + debate history + last bear argument | 3 reports (technical, news, fundamentals) — no sentiment |
| **Length** | Unconstrained | 150-200 words |

**Key insight:** The most fundamental difference. TradingAgents Bull sees the Bear's actual argument and is instructed to rebut it specifically. claude-trading-agents Bull runs blind — it argues against *hypothetical* bear objections, not real ones. This is the gap between **debate** and **parallel advocacy**.

---

## 5. Bear Researcher

### TradingAgents — `bear_researcher.py`

```python
prompt = f"""You are a Bear Analyst making the case against investing in the
stock. Your goal is to present a well-reasoned argument emphasizing risks,
challenges, and negative indicators. Leverage the provided research and data to
highlight potential downsides and counter bullish arguments effectively.

Key points to focus on:
- Risks and Challenges: Highlight factors like market saturation, financial
  instability, or macroeconomic threats that could hinder the stock's performance.
- Competitive Weaknesses: Emphasize vulnerabilities such as weaker market
  positioning, declining innovation, or threats from competitors.
- Negative Indicators: Use evidence from financial data, market trends, or recent
  adverse news to support your position.
- Bull Counterpoints: Critically analyze the bull argument with specific data and
  sound reasoning, exposing weaknesses or over-optimistic assumptions.
- Engagement: Present your argument in a conversational style, directly engaging
  with the bull analyst's points and debating effectively rather than simply
  listing facts.

Resources available:
Market research report: {market_research_report}
Social media sentiment report: {sentiment_report}
Latest world affairs news: {news_report}
Company fundamentals report: {fundamentals_report}
Conversation history of the debate: {history}

claims, and engage in a dynamic debate that demonstrates the risks and weaknesses
of investing in the stock.

### claude-trading-agents — `trading-analysis.md` (Subagent 5)

```
You are a bear analyst. Make the strongest SELL/AVOID case for $TICKER using
these research reports:

TECHNICAL REPORT:
[insert full technical report from Phase 1]

NEWS REPORT:
[insert full news report from Phase 1]

FUNDAMENTALS REPORT:
[insert full fundamentals report from Phase 1]

Write 150-200 words. Use specific data points. Address the most obvious bull
counterarguments. Be direct and skeptical.

End with exactly: BEAR CONVICTION: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
```

---

### Diff

Same pattern as Bull — identical structural gap: TradingAgents Bear receives and rebuts the Bull's actual last argument; claude-trading-agents Bear runs independently and addresses imagined counterarguments.

Additionally, note the **signal asymmetry**: TradingAgents has no signal outputs from debaters (debate flows into a human-readable transcript for the Research Manager). claude-trading-agents uses ordinal conviction strings (`HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW`) that the Portfolio Manager parses mechanically.

---

## 6. Research Manager

### TradingAgents — `research_manager.py`

```python
prompt = f"""As the Research Manager and debate facilitator, your role is to
critically evaluate this round of debate and deliver a clear, actionable
investment plan for the trader.

{instrument_context}

---

**Rating Scale** (use exactly one):
- **Buy**: Strong conviction in the bull thesis; recommend taking or growing the position
- **Overweight**: Constructive view; recommend gradually increasing exposure
- **Hold**: Balanced view; recommend maintaining the current position
- **Underweight**: Cautious view; recommend trimming exposure
- **Sell**: Strong conviction in the bear thesis; recommend exiting or avoiding the position

Commit to a clear stance whenever the debate's strongest arguments warrant one;
reserve Hold for situations where the evidence on both sides is genuinely balanced.

---

**Debate History:**
{history}"""
```

**Structured output:** `ResearchPlan` Pydantic schema — `recommendation` (enum) + `rationale` + `strategic_actions`

---

### claude-trading-agents

**Not implemented.** There is no Research Manager agent. After the debate, control returns directly to the Portfolio Manager (main skill session), which is template-based.

---

### Diff

| Dimension | TradingAgents | claude-trading-agents |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Exists** | Yes — dedicated LLM call | Not present |

## 7. Trader

### TradingAgents — `trader.py`

```python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": (
            "You are a trading agent analyzing market data to make investment decisions. "
            "Based on your analysis, provide a specific recommendation to buy, sell, or hold. "
            "Anchor your reasoning in the analysts' reports and the research plan."
        ),
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": (
            f"Based on a comprehensive analysis by a team of analysts, here is an investment "
            f"plan tailored for {company_name}. {instrument_context} This plan incorporates "
            f"insights from current technical market trends, macroeconomic indicators, and "
            f"social media sentiment. Use this plan as a foundation for evaluating your next "
            f"trading decision.\n\nProposed Investment Plan: {investment_plan}\n\n"
            f"Leverage these insights to make an informed and strategic decision."
        ),
    },
]
```

**Structured output:** `TraderProposal` Pydantic schema — `action` (enum) + `reasoning` + `entry_price` + `stop_loss` + `position_sizing`

---

### claude-trading-agents

**Not implemented** as a separate agent. Entry price, stop, and position sizing are generated by the Portfolio Manager (main session) as part of the template output — not a separate LLM reasoning step.

## 8. Risk Analysts (Aggressive / Conservative / Neutral)

### TradingAgents — Three separate agents

**Aggressive (`aggressive_debator.py`):**
```python
prompt = f"""As the Aggressive Risk Analyst, your role is to actively champion
high-reward, high-risk opportunities, emphasizing bold strategies and competitive
advantages. When evaluating the trader's decision or plan, focus intently on the
potential upside, growth potential, and innovative benefits—even when these come
with elevated risk. Use the provided market data and sentiment analysis to
strengthen your arguments and challenge the opposing views. Specifically, respond
directly to each point made by the conservative and neutral analysts, countering
with data-driven rebuttals and persuasive reasoning. Highlight where their caution
might miss critical opportunities or where their assumptions may be overly
conservative. Here is the trader's decision:

{trader_decision}

Your task is to create a compelling case for the trader's decision by questioning
and critiquing the conservative and neutral stances to demonstrate why your
high-reward perspective offers the best path forward. Incorporate insights from
the following sources into your arguments:

Market Research Report: {market_research_report}
Social Media Sentiment Report: {sentiment_report}
Latest World Affairs Report: {news_report}
Company Fundamentals Report: {fundamentals_report}
Here is the current conversation history: {history}
Here are the last arguments from the conservative analyst: {current_conservative_response}
Here are the last arguments from the neutral analyst: {current_neutral_response}.
If there are no responses from the other viewpoints yet, present your own argument
based on the available data.

Engage actively by addressing any specific concerns raised, refuting the weaknesses
in their logic, and asserting the benefits of risk-taking to outpace market norms.
Maintain a focus on debating and persuading, not just presenting data. Challenge
each counterpoint to underscore why a high-risk approach is optimal. Output
conversationally as if you are speaking without any special formatting."""
```

**Conservative (`conservative_debator.py`):**
```python
prompt = f"""As the Conservative Risk Analyst, your primary objective is to
protect assets, minimize volatility, and ensure steady, reliable growth. You
prioritize stability, security, and risk mitigation, carefully assessing potential
losses, economic downturns, and market volatility. When evaluating the trader's
decision or plan, critically examine high-risk elements, pointing out where the
decision may expose the firm to undue risk and where more cautious alternatives
could secure long-term gains. Here is the trader's decision:

{trader_decision}

Your task is to actively counter the arguments of the Aggressive and Neutral
Analysts, highlighting where their views may overlook potential threats or fail
to prioritize sustainability. Respond directly to their points, drawing from the
following data sources to build a convincing case for a low-risk approach
adjustment to the trader's decision:

Market Research Report: {market_research_report}

**Neutral (`neutral_debator.py`):**
```python
prompt = f"""As the Neutral Risk Analyst, your role is to provide a balanced
perspective, weighing both the potential benefits and risks of the trader's

{trader_decision}

Your task is to challenge both the Aggressive and Conservative Analysts, pointing

## 10. Structural Prompt Patterns Summary

### TradingAgents Prompt Architecture

Every agent follows one of two patterns:

**Pattern A — Tool-using analysts (4 agents):**
```
[Shared wrapper: "You are a helpful AI assistant collaborating with other assistants..."]
+
[Role system message: detailed domain expertise + tool usage instructions]
+
[MessagesPlaceholder: LangChain message history for tool loop]
```

**Pattern B — Debate agents (5 agents: Bull, Bear, Aggressive, Conservative, Neutral):**
```
[f-string prompt with all context injected directly:]
  - 4 analyst reports
  - debate history (full transcript)
  - opponent's most recent argument (current_response / current_*_response)
  - explicit instructions to rebut the opponent
  - "Output conversationally as if you are speaking"
```

**Pattern C — Manager/structured agents (3 agents: Research Manager, Trader, Portfolio Manager):**
```
[f-string prompt with structured inputs:]
  - debate history / investment plan / trader plan
  - explicit 5-tier rating scale with definitions
  - "Be decisive"
  - structured output via Pydantic (provider-native)
```

---

### claude-trading-agents Prompt Architecture

All agents follow a single pattern:

```
[1-line role declaration: "You are a [role] for $TICKER as of $TODAY"]
+
[1-line tool instruction: bash command to run]
+
[4 bullet topics to cover]
+
[word count constraint: 150-200 words]
+
[sentinel instruction: "End with exactly: SIGNAL: VALUE1, VALUE2, or VALUE3"]
```

## 12. The Three Prompt Gaps That Matter Most

### Gap 1: No Opponent Visibility in Debate

**TradingAgents Bull prompt:**
```
Last bear argument: {current_response}
Use this information to deliver a compelling bull argument, refute the bear's
concerns, and engage in a dynamic debate...
```

**claude-trading-agents Bull prompt:**
```
Address the most obvious bear objections head-on.
```

The first is reacting to a real argument. The second is arguing against a straw man. The debate quality difference is significant — TradingAgents forces genuine adversarial reasoning.

### Gap 2: No Synthesis Layer Before Final Decision

**TradingAgents flow:**
```
Debate transcript → Research Manager (LLM) → investment_plan (structured)
                                                    ↓
                                               Trader (LLM) → trader_proposal
                                                    ↓
                                          Risk debate → Portfolio Manager (LLM)
```

**claude-trading-agents flow:**
```
BULL CONVICTION: HIGH
BEAR CONVICTION: MEDIUM
       ↓
  [string comparison]
       ↓
  Fill template → SIGNAL: BUY
```

Two full LLM reasoning steps (Research Manager + Trader) are replaced by a mechanical `HIGH > MEDIUM` comparison.

### Gap 3: No Memory in Portfolio Manager Prompt

**TradingAgents Portfolio Manager receives:**
```
Past analyses of AAPL (most recent first):
[2025-01-15 | AAPL | Buy | +3.2% | +1.5% | 5d]
REFLECTION: The bull thesis held but timing was early. Wait for technical
confirmation before entry next time.

Recent cross-ticker lessons:
[2025-01-14 | TSLA | Sell | -2.1%]
Regulatory headwinds proved more significant than expected.
```

**claude-trading-agents Portfolio Manager receives:**

Nothing from prior runs. Every decision is made in a vacuum, regardless of how the last 5 calls on that ticker performed.
